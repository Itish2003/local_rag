# Project Ideas for 2025

    ## Q1: AI-Powered Local Knowledge Base
    The main goal is to create a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that runs locally. It should be able to index a directory of markdown and text files. The core technologies will be Go for the backend, Ollama for embeddings, and Gemini for the generative part.

    ## Q2: Personal Finance Dashboard
    A web application to track personal expenses and investments, possibly using Plaid API for bank connections.
